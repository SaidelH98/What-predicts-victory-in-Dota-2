# What-predicts-victory-in-Dota-2 
Final Project for COGS 109

There are many variables that go into why a team won a match of Dota, and not the other team. Things like a team having a higher gpm (gold per minute) and xpm (experience points per minute) as well as team total kills and assists. GPM is typically the variable that tells which team is winning in a match of Dota. People casting a game of Dota will typically refer to gpm and gold difference to get a sense on if a team is winning (though this may not always be the case). If a team has a higher gold difference and gpm than the other they will have an advantage, because that team will have access to more powerful items and are more favored in teamfights. In this project, we aim to find which aspects of the game most correlate a team’s gpm. The dataset Dota 2 Matches  on kaggle.com by Devin Anzelmo is a collection of 50,000 matches of Dota 2 from 2016, recording important features of each match like items bought, heroes picked, total gold, the game’s all chat, etc . Using this dataset, we are able to see the gpm differences between winning teams and losing teams and see if variables like assists, deaths, and last hits correlate with a higher gpm. In conducting this project, we hypothesize that team based statistics like gpm and xpm most correlate with a higher chance of a team winning and that winning teams will typically have more last hits and assists than the losing team but have less deaths.
